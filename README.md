# MPMB-WotC-Subclasses-for-UA-Classes
This script adds the official WotC subclasses to the 2022-2023 series of Unearthed Arcana articles, altering them to be in accordance with the UA subclass progressions.

**Script Credit Note:**
This file has been compiled by MasterJedi2014, ripping almost all of its code from MPMB and those who have contributed to the sheet's existing material. The only things in this script that I can currently take credit for are:
1. Alterations made to add these subclasses to the UA versions of the classes (adding a suffix to class names);
2. Alterations made to bring a subclass' level progression in-line with the level progression of the UA versions of the classes (so far this only includes the Cleric);
3. Alterations made to bring a subclass feature into parity with the UA version of a similar subclass feature (so far only includes the lvl 20 Paladin subclass features aside from the one in Oath of Redemption).

# This script is currently a work in progress & currently only includes the classes that I have coded into the sheets already. It will be updated to include new classes as I code them into the sheets.
_**This script DOES NOT add the Artificer class because it is not a part of the playtesting for the upcoming revision to 5th Edition.**_
